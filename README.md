# Bike_Book
BikeBook is an online bike rental system. A company named bikebook offers multiple categories of bikes for rent for people around the country. 
We have designed an application from where the customer can register to rent their desirable bike or bicycle for a specific time. 
This is a simple web-based open source software written in HTML, CSS, PHP.
                        
DON'T FORGET TO CREATE A DATABASE NAMING "hostel.sql" AND IMPORT THE SQL FILE AND RUN.
WITHOUT THE DATABASE THE PROJECT WON'T RUN.
